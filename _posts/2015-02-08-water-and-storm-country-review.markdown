Water & Storm Country is the second book in the Country Saga. See my previous review <a href="/book-reviews/david-estes/2015/02/03/ice-country-review.html" _target="blank">[here]</a> for the second book in this series.

Water & Storm Country follows both Sadie and Huck. Both Sadie and Huck are on opposite sides of a feud, both have problems with their parents, but come out on top to rise to the occasion, once again.

I still feel that not that much happened for most of the book in distinction with the others. Parents die, or are dead, our main characters harp on their deaths, become stronger and save the say. The three books seemed eerily similar, especially reading them in succession like I did. I liked Huck because his story appeared a to be slightly different than the others, but I feel like he too quickly stepped up to the plate to find success in leadership on his new ship when he was painted as quite the unprepared little boy before going there.

Also, just because it's a young adult series doesn't mean every character has to get paired off with their soulmate, either! I liked that Sadie was strong, but fell into the same trap in this one. Huck and Jade, I could deal with, but all the characters appeared to be paired off with someone by the end of the Saga. 

The reason for the low rating is simply that I didn't feel enough diversity between the three books in the Saga. I felt like I read the same book three times in a row with just slight variations. We find out a little more information, but I felt that I was just reading through it so I could get back to Adele and Tristan and the Moon Dweller's Saga to see what's going to happen with the Glassies.
