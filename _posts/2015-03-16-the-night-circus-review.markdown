Celia and Marco embark on a challenge of their magical talents, insisted upon by their teachers, where the circus is their gameboard. The two spend nearly fifteen years making subtle moves against each other in an effort for one to turn out the winner.

I really loved this book. I didn't want to put it down and I didn't want it to be over. The circus in this story was painted so beautifully and magically that I wanted to actually go and experience it. The characters were all very interesting and I enjoyed getting to know them and their different talents.

The premise was really cool. I liked the idea of having two magicians, with different thoughts and teachings on magic, go head to head in a sort of competition, where no one knew the rules, how the winner was determined, etc. Celia and Marco are two very complex characters who get roped into a game against their wills.

The one thing I would have liked would have been a little bit more backstory on their teachers and how this game of theirs came to be. Celia and Marco weren't the first two students to compete against each other. We do find out a little of the teachers backstory, but not too much. They were veiled in a little bit of mystery. I definitely recommend this book, though, it was great!
