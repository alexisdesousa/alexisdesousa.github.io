Harry August gets to relive life over and over again. When Harry dies, he is reborn at the same place and time, with all of his memories intact. At the end of one of his lives, Harry is visited by a young girl with a message passed down through others of his kind: the world is ending and now it's his job to figure out what to do about it.
