I haven't posted in a long time, but I figured with the end of the year coming up, I'd post a list of my favorite books I've read this year! Some of them I reviewed earlier on, while others I haven't. I figured I'd do this list because I've read <i>a lot</i> this year: 135 books and still counting (the year isn't over yet!). Some of these were published this year, but some weren't. If you're looking for some interesting books to read, check them out!

Let me know in the comments of any of your favorite books you've read this year. I love recommendations!

<b>The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern</b><br/><br/>

Erin Morgenstern blends the charms of the circus with the dangers of magic so smoothly that she had me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading. This novel pits two magicians and their apprentices against each other in a game of life or death with the circus as their game board. Truly magical, I fell in love with the characters instantly!

<b>A Darker Shade of Magic by Victoria Schwab</b><br/><br/>

The first in a series, this book has magicians traveling through doors to other London's, some good and some horribly bad. The story is fresh and at the end, I definitely couldn't wait for more.

<b>11/22/63 by Stephen King</b><br/><br/>

What if you could go back in time and prevent JFK from being assasinated? King takes that idea and runs with it. Jake Epping attempts to do the impossible and you won't believe the consequences of his actions. I love King and this was just another great story from a great master of writing.

<b>Red Rising by Pierce Brown</b><br/><br/>

I read both Red Rising and Golden Son this year and fell in love with Pierce Brown. This series is disturbing and gritty and I can't wait for the finale next year. I first described this book as a Hunger Games in space, but it's so much more than that. The world Pierce Brown has created is amazing and the characters are all blood thirsty for revolution and revenge against an evil empire and caste system. Read it, you won't regret it.

<b>The Yiddish Policeman's Union by Michael Chabon</b><br/><br/>

Michael Chabon really is a captivating writer. This and Kavalier and Clay are the only two books of his I've read so far, but I plan on reading his others as well. This book is a bit of alternate history, as if the Jews were never given Israel after WWII and, instead, settled in Alaska. There's some detective work and Jewish history in this one and I was really drawn to it. I enjoy alternate history books and this one really moves quickly despite its length.

<b>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay by Michael Chabon</b><br/><br/>

In this novel, Kavalier escapes Nazi's and moves to New York to live with his cousin, Sam Clay. The two end up starting a really successful comic book series. Throughout the book, Kavalier is constantly trying to get the rest of his family to New York and we follow the ups and downs of his adventure to do so. This book can be heartbreaking at times, but it really is an amazing adventure.

<b>Sandman Series by Neil Gaiman</b><br/><br/>

I've read though this series to about the fifth compilation and it really is an amazing story. It really draws you in and the stories are all really great. Also, I think the Sandman is totally drawn to look like Neil Gaiman!

<b>Nimona by Noelle Stevenson</b><br/><br/>

I had Nimona on my list for most of the year and was pleasantly surprised to find that my local library had it in stock! Nimona is about a rambunctions shape shifter who joins forces with an apparently evil villian to take down an even eviler corporation. Nimona is fun and hilarious! She is probably a comic book character that I fell in love with the most, as it's very hard to establish much depth of character in just one graphic novel. She is amazing.
