I haven't posted in a long time, but I figured with the end of the year coming up, I'd post a list of my favorite books I've read this year! Some of them I reviewed earlier on, while others I haven't. I figured I'd do this list because I've read <i>a lot</i> of books this year: 135 and still counting (the year isn't over yet!). Some of these books were published this years, but some weren't. If you're looking for some interesting books to read, check them out!
