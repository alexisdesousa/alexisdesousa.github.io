Follow Auri as she explores the Underthing, a maze beneath the University from the Kingkiller Chronicles, where she lives.

There's really not much to say about this book. Relatively little happens. The book is set over the course of one week in Auri's life. We know from the Kingkiller Chronicles that Auri is odd. We learn in this book that Auri really is cut from a different cloth. The thing about Auri, though, is her genuine sweetness and even though the book is riddled with her OCD (running to and fro throughout the maze to make sure every object is in its rightful place), there are those moments that really strike you about her character and what may have happened to her in the past.

While I didn't love this book, I loved the writing style. The way Rothfuss writes makes the objects Auri finds come to life in a different way. The objects are the other characters in the story. I wish we had learned a little bit more about Auri's backstory. I want to know so much more about her. I do love her character and her quirks.
